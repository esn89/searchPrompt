Installation
===============
Getting this to run is rather simple.

Copy the contents of the websearchKey.lua into the section called "Global Hotkeys" in your rc.lua.  

The rc.lua can normally be found in /home/your_username/.config/awesome/

Next, place the "awesomesearch" script in your /usr/local/bin/ 

Restart awesome by:  ctrl+mod4+r and to conduct a search:
                     modr+s

How to conduct searches
-----------------------

After mod4+s a Web Search will pop up at the top left corner:

A typical search consists of the first letter for the search engine, and then your query.

- g for google
- r for reddit
- d for duckduckgo
- w for wikipedia
- e for ebay
- y for youtube
