-------------

- Switched the control statements from "if" to
"switch-cases".
(cleaner, easier to read)

- Handling of arguments now uses $1 for the first parameter,
and $@ for all.

- Fixed an issue where entering more than two letters for
search causes a shift in strings.

- Fixed an issue where there is more than one white space
between search engine letter and search term.

- The code now pinpoints where the exact error falls in:
  "search engine field is empty"
  "not a valid defined search engine definition"
  "search engine field is too long" (i.e: "yy" for youtube
		  won't work")

- Quietly exits when search engine has an error.
